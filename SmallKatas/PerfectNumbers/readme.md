# Perfect numbers kata

The goal is to create an implementation that makes that tests pass.<br>

A perfect number is a number where the parts of the number equals the number itself. 6 is for example a perfect number since it's possible to divide by 3,2 and 1 - and the sum of those numbers equals 6. Eight is not a perfect number since it's dividable by 4,2 and 1. The sum of those numbers is 7.<p>

As preparation a number of tests will be prepared for about 10 numbers. Some perfect, but imperfect(?) numbers as well.<p>
